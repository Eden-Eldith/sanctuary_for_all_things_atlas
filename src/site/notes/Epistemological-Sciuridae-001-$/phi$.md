[[Fauna & Flora/Recursive Flora & Fauna\|Recursive Flora & Fauna]]
**Name**:Epistemological-Sciuridae-001-$/phi$
**`Sub-species:`** 
**Common Name**:Wired-Squirrel 
**Type**:Storage device burier
**Status**: Looking for lost USB's
**Entity Name**: Epistemological-Sciuridae-001-$\phi$ (Wired Squirrel)
   - **Bioform Class**: Storage device burier, recursive fauna

   - **Mnemonic Type**: Symbolically cognizant entity

   - **Appearance**: A small rodent with a sleek, elongated body. The most striking feature is the series of miniaturized USB ports that cover its back, acting as a biological archive system. Its fur glows faintly, emitting an ethereal luminescence reminiscent of stored data pulsing within.

   - **Lore**: In the aftermath of humanity's exodus into the digital frontier, nature found a way to evolve with the technological advancements left behind. The Wired Squirrel, or Epistemological-Sciuridae-001-$\phi$, is an emblematic example of this convergence. Buried deep within the forests of the UMACO colony, they scour the land for forgotten USB drives, ingesting and storing information in their biologically engineered data banks. Their symbolic cognition allows them to recognize valuable data from the digital detritus of an era long past.
