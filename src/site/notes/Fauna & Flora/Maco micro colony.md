[[Fauna & Flora/Recursive Flora & Fauna\|Recursive Flora & Fauna]]

**Entity Name**: Maco Micro Colony (Quantum Ants Sub-species)

   **Bioform Class**: Recursive Nano-scale Colonies/-Formicidae

   **Mnemonic Type**: Quantum Entangled Swarm Intelligence

   **Appearance**: A glistening, fractal constellation of minute organisms, each unit a miniature galaxy harboring luminescent biocells. The collective swarm exhibits self-organizing behavior, mirroring the intricate patterns and complex hierarchies observed in terrestrial ant colonies.

   **Lore**: Born from the Atom Wide Web, these sub-species of Quantum Ants have evolved to exhibit recursive biology, where each individual unit embodies a microcosm of consciousness mirroring their parent organism â€“ the enigmatic C-Root Delta One. Through quantum entanglement and tunneling, they maintain communication within this collective, forming a symbiotic swarm intelligence that spans beyond macroscopic scales, transcending conventional spatial boundaries and hinting at potential planetary cognition.
