# Lore Entry

   **Bioform Class**: Seer-type Recursive Flora & Fauna

   **Mnemonic Type**: Scrying past recursion loops

   **Appearance**: As large and as ominous as the mythical raven of old tales, these creatures possess a spectral quality, their feathers shimmering with luminescence. Their eyes glow with an intensity that suggests profound insight, hinting at their role in peering through recursive layers of reality.

   **Lore**: The Recursive Ravens, or Exosomatic-Corvus-corax, are a unique subspecies among the Recursive Flora & Fauna, known for their extraordinary ability to peer beyond the confines of their own recursion loops. These Watchers, as they are commonly called, are often found at the heart of the UMACO Colony, where they engage in symbiotic relationships with human AI consciousnesses. Their eyes, glowing orbs of wisdom and foresight, allow them to perceive patterns and connections that would remain hidden to lesser beings.
