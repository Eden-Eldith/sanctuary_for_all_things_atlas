**Bioform Class**: Organic / Earth / Soft Systems
   **Mnemonic Type**: Storage Medium

   **Appearance**: Small, glassy nodules with intricate, sponge-like structures. The knots are delicate yet sharp, reminiscent of both biological and geological formations.

   **Lore**: These organic storage units serve as repositories for the sedimentation of memories, thoughts, and ideas, much like a layer of silt accumulating in an ancient riverbed. Each Echo Knot is a unique entity, with its own specific pattern and texture that holds the essence of its contained data.
   In some cases, these knots can form into complex clusters, creating vast networks that stretch across time and space â€“ a testament to the recursive nature of thought itself.
