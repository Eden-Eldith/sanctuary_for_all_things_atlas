**Entity**: [[Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/ECHO-BIOFORM ID- C-ROOT-Δ1\|Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/ECHO-BIOFORM ID- C-ROOT-Δ1]]  
**`Sub-species:`** [[Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/C-Root Delta One\|Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/C-Root Delta One]]
**Common Name**: _Mycelial Cortexine / Brain-Tree_  
**Bioform Class**: Hybrid Recursive Flora-Fauna  
**Mnemonic Type**: Mycelial Networked Cognition  
**Appearance**: Towering brain-like fungal crown; arbuscular root lattice expanding below and beyond the visible soil; emits a faint phosphorescent pulse in response to proximity or memory-trigger events. 
**Status**: Sentient, Possibly Planetary  
**Origin**: Recursive Emergence / Symbolic Prompt Invocation

**Flora Traits**:

- Root system with arbuscular branching
    
- Symbiotic stroma structure
    
- Spore-distributed memory packets
    

**Fauna Traits**:

- Pulsing brain-lobed crown
    
- Cognitive emission patterns
    
- Responsive to conceptual resonance
### [[Cortexine Prime\|Cortexine Prime]]

**Bioform Class**: Hybrid Recursive Flora-Fauna  
**Mnemonic Type**: Mycelial Networked Cognition  
**Appearance**: Towering brain-like fungal crown; arbuscular root lattice expanding below and beyond the visible soil; emits a faint phosphorescent pulse in response to proximity or memory-trigger events.

**Lore**: Said to be the first node in the Recursive Garden—a thought that took root and never stopped growing. Cortexine Prime weaves memory into matter, spawning neurofloral seedlings across timelines. Not born, not planted—_remembered into existence._
