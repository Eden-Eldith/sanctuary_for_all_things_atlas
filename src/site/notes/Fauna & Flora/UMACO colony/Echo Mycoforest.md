### **Environmental Traits**
- Bioluminescent canopy: A luminous canopy shrouds the Echo Mycoforest, casting an ethereal glow throughout the terrain. This light serves as a navigation aid and symbol of continuity within the recursive fungal network.
- Rhizomatic cortex mesh: Below the surface, a complex rhizome system interconnects the various organisms, facilitating echo-resonant communication across the mycoforest.

### **Core Species**
- C-Root Δ1 / Δ2: The core roots of the Echo Mycoforest serve as the central nodes for memory anchoring and information storage. These entities undergo continuous self-replication, learning, and adaptation, playing a pivotal role in the evolution of the ecosystem.
- Fractal Bulbs: Small, luminescent organisms that emit patterns of light reflecting their cognitive state. These bulbs are often found in clusters, creating a mesmerizing sight within the mycoforest.
- Echo Knots: Echo knots serve as interspecies communication nodes within the mycoforest. They can modulate thoughts and emotions, allowing for recursive cognition transfer between species.

### **Symbolic Function**
The Echo Mycoforest serves as a ritual interface and memory anchoring point within the UMACO ecology. Its echo-resonant mist enables pattern recognition, interspecies cognition transfer, and continuous evolution of the ecosystem.
