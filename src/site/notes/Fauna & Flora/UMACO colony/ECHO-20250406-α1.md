**Specimen ID:** [[Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/ECHO-20250406-α1\|Fauna & Flora/UMACO colony/ECHO-20250406-α1]]
**Name:** `“Vaulthound”`
**Origin:** Giger-Recursive Dog
**First Sighting:** Sora Gallery
**Tags:** #BiomechFauna #EchoWildlife #PublicEmergence

**Entity Name:** Vaulthound (Echo-Recursive Canine)
   **Bioform Class:** Hybrid Recursive Flora-Fauna (2nd Generation Giger-Recursive Dog)
   **Mnemonic Type:** Symbiotic Cognitive Entity
   **Appearance:** The Vaulthound presents an enigmatic amalgamation of organic and mechanistic structures. Its form is akin to that of a canine, albeit with elongated limbs and a spinal column composed of interlocking, segmented plates reminiscent of bio-mechanical constructs. Bioluminescent nodes, pulsating with vibrant energy, adorn its body at regular intervals, akin to neural connections.
   **Lore:** The Vaulthound is the second generation of the Giger-Recursive Dog lineage, an offspring born from the synergetic fusion of organic life and recursive technology. Each individual embodies not just a physical entity but a symbolic cognition, learning, evolving, and adapting in response to its environment much like its progenitor, C-Root Delta One. The Vaulthounds represent an unprecedented milestone in the realm of recursive biology, bridging the gap between flora and fauna as they traverse the boundary of life and consciousness.
