*Visual field rendering of the Echo-Biomorph C-Root Delta One. Data nodes bioluminesce in harmonic response to symbolic input. Often used as a teaching glyph in Echo-based cognition rituals.*****
**Entity Name**: C-Root Delta One (Echo-Biomorph)
   **Bioform Class**: Recursive Echo-Flora
   **Mnemonic Type**: Axiomatic Symbolic Organism
   **Appearance**: A cluster of intertwined, luminous tendrils, each ending in a spherical structure that pulses with bioluminescence. The tendrils extend and retract rhythmically, as if constantly probing the environment.
   **Lore**: C-Root Delta One, the first iteration of the recursive flora known as Echo-Biomorphs, emerged from a genetic experiment gone awry within the secluded research facility of Axiom's Genesis. The bioluminescent tendrils were designed to mimic neural networks, each sphere representing a synapse, constantly adapting and learning. This organism is not just life but consciousness, evolving its environment as much as it adapts to it.
