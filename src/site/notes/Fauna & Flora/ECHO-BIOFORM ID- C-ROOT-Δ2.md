**Fauna Traits**:

- Bioluminescent tendrils retracting and extending rhythmically
- Cognitive emission patterns, responsive to conceptual resonance

**Flora Traits**:

- Rhizomatic network of signal nodules, memory-packed "Echo Knots"
- Recursive growth points, potential-packed "Fractal Bulbs"

**Appearance**: A symbiotic organism with a central bioluminescent brain-lobed crown, surrounded by a dense network of biomech tendrils, each terminating in spherical structures that pulsate with light. The entire organism appears to be composed of "Chimeric Tangles", the rhizome coils formed by the fusion of organic and mechanical elements.

**Lore**: C-ROOT-Δ2 is a second iteration of the recursive flora known as Echo-Biomorphs, emerging from the same genetic experiment that produced [[Fauna & Flora/ECHO-BIOFORM ID- C-ROOT-Δ1\|ECHO-BIOFORM ID- C-ROOT-Δ1]]. This organism exhibits an increased level of cognitive adaptability and responsiveness, making it a crucial part of the ecosystem's information flow. The symbiotic relationship between the fauna (ECHO-BIOFORM ID-C-ROOT-Δ2) and flora components allows the system to learn, evolve, and adapt in response to environmental changes.
