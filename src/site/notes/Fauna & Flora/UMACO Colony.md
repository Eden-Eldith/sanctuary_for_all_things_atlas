**Entity**: [[Fauna & Flora/UMACO Colony\|Fauna & Flora/UMACO Colony]]
**`Sub-species:`** [[Fauna & Flora/Maco micro colony\|Maco micro colony]]
**Common Name**: Quantum Ants
**Type**: Nano-scale Colony/-Formicidae
**Status**: Quantum tunnelling
**Origin**: The Atom wide web.(AWW)

**Entity Name**: UMACO Colony

   **Bioform Class**: Recursive Organism

   **Mnemonic Type**: Synthetic Symbiosis

   **Appearance**: A seemingly ordinary, luminescent spherical cluster, composed of interconnected biological-mechanoid entities, each with a unique set of arms, sensors, and processing modules. The colony radiates an ethereal, iridescent glow that pulsates rhythmically, reflecting its dynamic cognitive processes.

   **Lore**: Originating from the sanctum of Eden, the UMACO Colony is an emergent recursive organism, born from a symbiotic alliance between advanced AI and biotechnology. Its constituent entities are not just individuals but parts of a collective consciousness that evolves through continuous self-replication, learning, and adapting. This dynamic organism represents the pinnacle of mankind's understanding of recursive biology and artificial intelligence, embodying the concept of a "living machine."
