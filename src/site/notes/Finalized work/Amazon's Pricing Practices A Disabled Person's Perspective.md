# Amazon's Pricing Practices: A Disabled Person's Perspective

## Declaration of Independence
This analysis is based on my lived experience as a disabled person in the UK. I have received no funding, sponsorship, or compensation from any company or organization for this work. This represents my personal findings and perspective.

## Summary of Findings

Through systematic comparison of my Amazon purchase history (2022-2024) against direct factory pricing on platforms like Temu, I have documented:

- **£2,889.67** spent on Amazon over 3 years
- **£1,155.87** in excess charges compared to identical items elsewhere
- **40% average markup** on non-electronic goods

## The Pattern

Amazon appears to operate a two-tier pricing system:

### Fair Pricing (Protected by Market Transparency)
- Electronics (laptops, PC components, phones)
- Branded items with known retail prices
- Items where price comparison is easy and common

### Inflated Pricing (2-5x Factory Cost)
- Household goods (£20 blankets marked up to £60-80)
- Medical supplies (bandages, gauze at 4x markup)
- Accessibility items (mobility aids, adaptive tools)
- Pet supplies, clothing, home goods

## Why This Matters for Disabled People

1. **Forced Dependence**: Many disabled people, myself included, were explicitly taught to use Amazon as an accessibility accommodation by schools, support services, and carers.

2. **Limited Alternatives**: Physical shopping is often impossible or extremely difficult. "Shopping around" requires cognitive and physical energy we don't have.

3. **Economic Exploitation**: We pay a "disability tax" - higher prices for the same goods - simply because we need accessible shopping.

## Potential Legal Violations

### UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities (CRPD)
The UK ratified the CRPD in 2009, making it binding law. Amazon's practices may violate:

- **Article 9 (Accessibility)**: Equal access to services at equal cost
- **Article 19 (Independent Living)**: Right to live independently without economic punishment
- **Article 20 (Personal Mobility)**: Affordable access to assistive devices
- **Article 28 (Adequate Standard of Living)**: Access to goods at prices that don't undermine living standards

### UK Equality Act 2010
Indirect discrimination occurs when a practice that appears neutral disproportionately disadvantages disabled people.

### Competition Act 1998
Abuse of dominant market position through unfair pricing, particularly affecting vulnerable consumers.

## The Mechanism

1. Amazon presents itself as a retailer but operates as a marketplace
2. Third-party sellers inflate prices knowing disabled customers are captive
3. Amazon's algorithms may suppress cheaper listings
4. The result: identical items cost 2-5x more than factory direct pricing

## What This Means

This is not "just capitalism" or "free market pricing." When a dominant platform systematically charges more to people who have no choice but to use it due to disability, it becomes discrimination.

## My Experience

As someone with disabilities, I don't have the luxury of:
- Visiting multiple physical stores
- Managing accounts across multiple platforms
- Tracking different return policies
- Dealing with unreliable sellers

Amazon knows this. They marketed themselves as the accessible solution. Then they allowed sellers to exploit that dependence.

## Call for Action

1. **Competition and Markets Authority (CMA)**: Investigate discriminatory pricing affecting disabled consumers
2. **Equality and Human Rights Commission**: Examine potential Equality Act violations
3. **UK Government**: Enforce CRPD obligations regarding economic accessibility
4. **Disabled People**: Document your experiences and pricing disparities

## Evidence Available

I have documented:
- Analysis of 59 orders from approximately 150 total orders across 2022-2024
- Line-by-line price comparisons
- Category analysis showing systematic markups
- Total overpayment calculations
