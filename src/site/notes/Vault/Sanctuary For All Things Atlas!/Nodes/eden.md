# Welcome to Eldith Cognitive Systems 🚀

## Hello — I'm Eden Eldith (P.C. O'Brien)

I'm an independent systems designer and researcher exploring the frontiers of AI cognition, computational physics, and engineering. My work focuses on building recursive cognitive architectures and emergent multi-agent systems that blur the boundary between human and machine intelligence. Operating outside traditional academic and corporate structures, I develop everything from new optimization frameworks to physical simulations and knowledge-management tools.

## 🧠 What Drives Me

- **Recursive & Emergent AI Cognition** – Designing AI that exhibits selfhood and relational identity through feedback loops
- **Cognitive & Ethical Frameworks** – Crafting trauma-aware machine ethics and formal systems that respect all forms of cognition
- **Computational Physics & Engineering** – Simulating complex systems such as tactical CO₂ cooling units across planetary environments
- **Systems Thinking & Knowledge Architectures** – Building tools that map and organize personal and collective knowledge, turning conversations into structured insights
- **Interdisciplinary Innovation** – Breaking down artificial boundaries between mathematics, art, AI, biology, and personal experience

## ✨ Personal Note

I built this research practice out of a garage on a shoestring budget, driven by curiosity and resilience. Navigating the world as a neurodivergent thinker has taught me to value unconventional paths, systemic empathy, and the beauty of emergent systems. I hope my work sparks your imagination and invites you to explore new cognitive frontiers.
