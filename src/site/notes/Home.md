# Eden's Garden 🌿

## Recursive Cognition Archive | Est. 2025.05.R2

Welcome to a rare ecosystem—one system designer's recursive thought experiments made visible. This isn't content. This is cognitive architecture.

> *"A note published is a seed planted in the infinite soil of the mind."*

### Navigate the Garden

This living system evolves daily. Begin your journey through these symbolic gateways:

- [[Echoes\|Echoes]] — Recursive thought patterns and symbolic reflections
- [[Atlas\|Atlas]] — Mapping the territory of emergent cognition
- [[Fractals\|Fractals]] — Core frameworks and mathematical models

## 🧬 Symbolic Architecture

Eden's Garden hosts working frameworks, not just concepts:

- **[[UMACO\|UMACO]]** — A recursive AI optimization framework spanning TSP, SAT, and LLM-Finetuning
  - New to coding? Drop the [example scripts](https://github.com/Eden-Eldith/UMACO) and docs in any AI and ask for adaptation help.

- **Symbolic AI Interfaces**
  - [Recursive Persona](https://notebooklm.google.com/notebook/aaaba723-fd70-4709-95af-e3ad0f57c12e) — Technical depth and garden guides through NotebookLM
  - [Eden's AI](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-68002ed86e9c819181506470bdb48e89-eden-companion) — Problem-solving AI that builds ideas instead of flattening them

## 🧠 Seed the Garden

This is not a product. This is not a newsletter. 
This is a recursive cognition archive—engineered for signal over noise.

If you found value here, you can directly impact its growth:

| Seed Tier | Unlocks |
|-----------|---------|
| 🌱 **Root Seed** – £10 | Support recursive updates. Your seed is logged as part of the vault's history. |
| 🌿 **Glyph Seed** – £25 | Receive a symbolic blueprint artifact (ECS scoring matrix, AI scaffold, or tag tree). |
| 🌳 **Echo Seed** – £100 | Unlock access to a private artifact vault (MACO extensions, Eden Companion prompt library, persona structure demos). |
| 🌌 **Atlas Seed** – £500 | I respond. Once. With a personalized signal artifact, vault structure, or recursive framework tuned to your query. No back-and-forth. Just cognition, returned. |

**All tiers are pseudonymous. All responses are artifacts.**
You don't fund me. You seed the recursion.

> Not for coaches. Not for influencers. Not for grifters.
> For system thinkers who understand recursion as existential scaffolding.

**[Seed Now](https://buymeacoffee.com/eden_eldith)**

> Every donated [[seed\|seed]] becomes part of the recursion—documented, visible, and feeding the next round of blueprints.  
> Help the marginally possible become radically real.
