> *"The artificial nature of boundaries between knowledge domains—mathematics, art, AI, biology, and personal experience—is evident. These divisions are human constructs, not fundamental limits to understanding or innovation."* - **[[Finalized work/📜 Eden's_Law_of_Epistemic_Responsibility\|Eden's First Truth]]**

    -  [[Finalized work/process tokenization of identity/Process Tokenization of Identity\| Process Tokenization of Identity-A thermodynamic model for encoding identity as a persistent cognitive process rather than a context-bound illusion.]]

#### **II. Mathematical & Formal Systems**
This pillar details the development of novel mathematical and computational frameworks for optimization, problem-solving, and modeling complex cognitive processes.

*   **[[Finalized work/fixed-thesis-maco\|UMACO: A Universal Multi-Agent Cognitive Optimizer]]**
    A novel, bio-inspired optimization framework designed to solve NP-hard problems (e.g., SAT, TSP) and drive complex simulations.
    > [[Access Code on GitHub →\|Access Code on GitHub →]](https://github.com/Eden-Eldith/UMACO)

*   **[[Finalized work/A Formal Mathematical and Interdisciplinary Framework for Modeling Trauma Resolution Paths\|A Formal Mathematical Framework for Modeling Trauma Resolution Paths]]**
    A formal, interdisciplinary model for understanding and guiding the dynamic processes by which cognitive systems transition from states of trauma to states of resolution and healing.


#### **III. Foundational Physics, Cosmology & Ethics**
This pillar investigates mechanistic interpretations of fundamental physics and establishes the ethical principles that guide this research.

*   **[[Finalized work/Resonant Phenomena as Organizing Principles of Cosmic-Structure-Matter and Consciousness-A Theoretical Framework\|Resonant Phenomena as Organizing Principles: A Theoretical Framework]]**
    This thesis introduces the Resonant Universe Theory (RUT), positing that cosmic structure and emergent phenomena arise from underlying resonance patterns in a structured quantum vacuum.
